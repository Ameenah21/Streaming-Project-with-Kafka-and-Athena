# Data Engineering Streaming Project with Kafka and Athena
This repository contains a data engineering streaming project that utilizes Apache Kafka for real-time data processing. The project involves setting up Kafka on an EC2 instance and creating a data catalog in Athena for efficient querying of the processed data.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a scalable and efficient streaming data pipeline using Kafka and Athena. The pipeline follows these main steps:

Data Ingestion: Data is ingested from various sources and streamed into Apache Kafka. Kafka provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming capabilities.

Data Transformation: The ingested data is processed and transformed using Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Spark Streaming. This step involves filtering, aggregating, enriching, or performing any required operations on the streaming data.

Data Storage: The processed data is stored in a data lake or data warehouse. In this project, we utilize Amazon S3 as the storage layer, where the transformed data is persisted in a structured format.

Data Cataloging: Athena, a serverless interactive query service provided by AWS, is used to create a data catalog for the stored data in S3. This enables fast and ad-hoc querying of the transformed data using standard SQL syntax.

# Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

kafka-setup/: Contains the necessary scripts and configurations to set up Kafka on an EC2 instance. This includes installation instructions, configuration files, and example producers/consumers for testing.

stream-processing/: Contains the code for data transformation using Kafka Streams or Spark Streaming. Depending on your preference and requirements, you can choose either Kafka Streams or Spark Streaming as the stream processing framework.

athena-cataloging/: Provides scripts and instructions to create a data catalog in Athena. It includes the necessary SQL statements to define tables and partitions based on the transformed data in S3.

README.md: The main README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

# Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the kafka-setup/ directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file to set up Kafka on an EC2 instance.

Once Kafka is set up and running, move to the stream-processing/ directory. Choose either Kafka Streams or Spark Streaming based on your preference and follow the instructions in the respective README files to set up the stream processing framework.

After the data transformation step is completed, proceed to the athena-cataloging/ directory. Follow the instructions provided in the README file to create a data catalog in Athena and define tables for querying the transformed data.

Finally, you can explore and analyze the transformed data by executing SQL queries using Athena's interactive query editor or any other SQL client of your choice.

# Dependencies
The project relies on the following technologies and frameworks:

Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform.
Apache Kafka Streams: A library for building real-time streaming applications.
Apache Spark Streaming: An extension of the Spark API for processing real-time data streams.
Amazon S3: A scalable object storage service provided by AWS.
Amazon Athena: A serverless interactive query service for analyzing data in S3.
Make sure to install and configure these dependencies before running the project.
